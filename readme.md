Build
=====

Uses gruntjs. 
The result is available on the */build/output/* folder.

* ```cd build``` - move to the build folder
* ```npm install``` - install the build dependencies
* ```grunt``` - development build
* ```grunt docs``` - build the documentation 
* ```grunt release``` release build


Examples
========

To try out the examples, start a local server at the root path (otherwise the preloading of assets won't work).

For example with python3: ```python -m http.server```
